# 1. Executive Summary - Project TravelTide - Feb'2025

### Company & Context
TravelTide, a leading online travel platform, is focused on improving customer retention by understanding user behavior and implementing a targeted rewards program. I analyzed user session data, and flight and hotel bookings to derive key metrics such as average session duration, conversion rate, cancellation proportion, and average spend per trip. 

### Objectives
- Measure engagement and financial metrics (e.g., session duration, conversion rate, average spend).
- Segment customers into groups that reflect their loyalty and revenue potential.
- Assign perks aligned with each segment’s characteristics to enhance retention and satisfaction.

### Key Metrics
Core metrics included total users, average session duration, conversion rate, cancellation proportion, average hotel spend per trip, and discount usage. These metrics provided a holistic view of user engagement and spending.

### Customer Segmentation
A composite score (combining bookings, spending, engagement, and conversion) was used to classify customers into six groups:
- Ultra High-Value
- High-Value Loyal
- Frequent Engaged
- Moderate
- Low Engagement
- At-Risk

This segmentation illuminates differences in behavior and informs tailored strategies.

### Perks Assignment
A range of perks (e.g., lounge access, free child ticket, extra legroom seats) was assigned based on segment profiles. Each segment is assigned a targeted perk—from premium rewards like Lounge Access and Extra Legroom Seats for high-value customers to introductory discounts for at-risk users.  The goal is to encourage further engagement from top customers and re-engage those at risk of churning.

### Initial Outcomes & Next Steps
High-value segments, though smaller, drive a significant share of revenue.
Lower-engagement segments may respond to introductory discounts or more flexible policies.
Future steps include A/B testing of perks, broader data integration, and direct customer feedback to refine and validate the approach.

This analysis lays the groundwork for a dynamic, data-driven approach to customer retention that will ultimately boost TravelTide’s long-term revenue and loyalty.
