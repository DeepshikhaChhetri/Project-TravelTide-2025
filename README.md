## Company & Context
TravelTide, a rapidly growing online travel platform, aims to strengthen customer retention by leveraging data-driven insights. The analysis focused on user behavior—sessions, bookings, cancellations, spending—to identify patterns that inform a targeted rewards program.

## Objectives
Measure engagement and financial metrics (e.g., session duration, conversion rate, average spend).
Segment customers into groups that reflect their loyalty and revenue potential.
Assign perks aligned with each segment’s characteristics to enhance retention and satisfaction.

## Key Metrics
Core metrics included total users, average session duration, conversion rate, cancellation proportion, average hotel spend per trip, and discount usage. These metrics provided a holistic view of user engagement and spending.

## Customer Segmentation
A composite score (combining bookings, spend, engagement, and conversion) was used to classify customers into six groups:
- Ultra High-Value
- High-Value Loyal
- Frequent Engaged
- Moderate
- Low Engagement
- At-Risk
This segmentation illuminates differences in behavior and informs tailored strategies.

## Perks Assignment
A range of perks (e.g., lounge access, free child ticket, extra legroom seats) was assigned based on segment profiles. The goal is to encourage further engagement from top customers and re-engage those at risk of churning.

## Initial Outcomes & Next Steps
High-value segments, though smaller, drive a significant share of revenue.
Lower-engagement segments may respond to introductory discounts or more flexible policies.
Future steps include A/B testing of perks, broader data integration, and direct customer feedback to refine and validate the approach.
